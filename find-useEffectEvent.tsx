// This is a temporary file to help us find all instances of useEffectEvent
// We'll delete this file after we've fixed the issue
//
// The error is: Attempted import error: 'useEffectEvent' is not exported from 'react'
//
// This suggests that somewhere in the codebase, there's an import like:
// import { useEffectEvent } from 'react'
//
// We need to find and fix all instances of this
